            <Description>
                I am a 21-year-old guy who resides in Campina Grande, Para√≠ba, Brazil. I commenced studying programming at university in 2020 and have been studying web development since 2021. I found my passion in frontend and it's been a pleasure to discover this universe. Besides the art of reading/writing code, I love music, (e)sports and philosophy.
